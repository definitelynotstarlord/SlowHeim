### SlowHeim, Take It Easy!
Welcome to SlowHeim! A modpack focused on a vanilla+ experience that offers a much slower pace and a bit more of a challenge than normal. 

I made this modpack for my young children and I for a family server playthrough. I uploaded this to Thunderstore to make it easier to manage updates for us. Before playing this modpack, please keep in mind it was made solely for my family's vision of what Valheim should be, with mods.

All of my changes are documented below.

## Performance Warning!
This modpack has 80+ mods. My goal was to add mods that I thought were necessary and that performed optimally as well. Still, it is a lot of mods and it does take a hit on performance.
- Game startup time for me is ~2m48s. Your screen may be white and even warning you that Valheim is not responding -- just click to "wait" for the program to respond
- 18-19GB memory utilization with under 5000 total instances
- 50% utilization on a 4070ti
- See the troubleshooting section below for additional performance enchancing tips

## Special Thanks
A special thanks to Majestic. His modpacks JewelHeim, RelicHeim, and RTMN are by far the best modpacks in Valheim and have given us hundreds of hours of fun and enjoyment. I learned how to modify various mod files because of his packs, and have reused a lot of his configs in this modpack as well. 

## Who Might Enjoy This Modpack?
- You enjoy vanilla Valheim but want more of a challenge without straying to far from the original game and concept
- You find Valheim's world to be too small and would like to slow down progression by simply making some things more difficult, especially exploration
- Not afraid of a grind
- Want a lot of options for armor and weapons

## Modpack Overview
- NoMap playthrough! The map has been moved to the Cartography table and you must plan ahead
- New raids
- Portals have been disabled but are replaced with craftable Waystones which act very similar, but add a cooldown based on your travel distance
- Access to magic much earlier through Therzie's Wizardry
- Southsil armor adds alternatives to Therzie's armory additions - find a style you like!
- ValheimEnchantingSystem to further upgrade your weapons and armor
- There are buffs and debuffs for each season
- Storms will negatively impact you, eventually leading to death - bring camping supplies!
- You will not be able to repair any items until you get to bronze
- All creatures can now be 0-3 stars, with bosses being 2-5 stars. Oceans are bit more dangerous with faster serpents
- Plants and trees will grow much, much more slowly and are not harvestable during winter
- Smelting ore and all conversions now take 5x longer
- A wandering trader will sometimes arrive, and he now buys a few more hunting and fishing related items
- Building pieces like Corewood, Glass, more vanilla pieces, etc. have been added
- A couple mods that attempt to help with network performance if you are playing with friends
- Lord of the Rings music overhaul (disable the LotR music mod AND the CustomAudio mod if you do not like this)

## World Modifiers
I would suggest you make the following changes on your world:
- Player-based raids
- Everything else default

## Detailed Changes - A Must Read!
These are the changes I have made to the game. I've added nearly 90 mods and configured quite a few of them as I see fit. Here you will find those changes and learn more details about this modpack.

- [Mods by Therzie](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Therzie/)
  - Therzie adds in so much content and has rounded out game completion
  - If you are unsure of how the Wizadry or Armor work, you need to read his Wiki, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kxXS34lWO-MWGktSqcOaRE_4tiLZHjN8sV1hxv2GsEU/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0)

    - Even though you are playing "NoMap", having multiple cartography tables throughout the world will slowly build a full map
    - Take note breaking the table destroys map data. If you would like to move your table, you must do so by taking advantage of the ZenRedecorate mod - instructions at the bottom of this section

  - Campsite (Raelaziel)
    - You can craft a Small Campfire, Sleeping Bag, Small Tent, and Big Tent. The Sleeping Bag and Tents require Campfire Resources. These recipes are changed from the original mod -- you will want to make sure you have plenty of Campfire Resources with you while traveling
  - TrainingPlace (Raelaziel, KG, and Gravebear)
    - Adds the ability to train your skills up, but all "vitamins" have been disabled
    - I feel like this offers massive potential for abuse, but 5% experience on death is a pretty big deal afterall!

  - Serpents are much faster and will be able to strike your boat with a more vicious bite
  - Haldor now buys fish, neck meat, deer meat, serpent meat, and more! Hunting and fishing could be lucrative

## Troubleshooting
- You can modify these mods in-game by pressing `F1` or by opening the config files themselves locally. I would recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you're wanting to edit config files locally, but Notepad++ and even Notepad do work
- This modpack was tested primarily on a 12th Gen i7-12700F, 4070ti, 48GB memory, and a Kingston SNV2S1000G with max graphics setting, and it runs perfectly fine. My kids played on older i7/i5s with an RTX 2060 and 16/32GB of memory and slightly lower graphics settings, and not a single issue either 
- Memory consumption issues can be a thing
  - Disable CustomAudio and Lord of the Rings Music to lower memory usage 7-8GB. You must disable both
- Poor performance
  - Though terraforming is restricted, excessive flattening can cause lag
  - Use `F2` to monitor your instances and stay as low as you can. Anything over 10,000 is definitely going to be a bad time
  - See the `Section 2: Optimize Boot Configuration for Better FPS` section at the [RobThePCGuy's Performance Mod Guide](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Performance-Mod-Guide-For-Valheim/blob/main/README.md). We see considerable boost in performance when using these options
- If you do not like the UI I put together, disable the "MinimalUI" mod. Alternatively, you can press "F7" at any time and use right-click to cycle through the various screens in which you can drag-and-drop how you'd like
- When installing on a server, make sure you're not adding the client-side mods. Use WinSCP to upload the mods via FTP

## Server Installation
- Disable SmoothSave on clients if you are uploading these mods to a server
- Copy everything to your server except for these mods:
 - LocalizationCache
 - MinimalUI
 - CustomAudio
 - Lord of the Rings Music
 - BepInEx Configuration Manager
- Once the above mods have been removed, shut your server down and copy your entire BepInEx folder to the server
- Watch [Stoned Prophet's Complete Starter's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqIvO_uJMw) as an excellent resource for setting up your server!
