## [Admin] Show the number of game days of fuel remaining on Fireplaces. (Vanilla: false)
## This helps you understand the different dynamics of the various light sources and realize they are not just cosmetic.
## The game itself does not provide a clock. Vikings had no clocks. The only unit of time they had was days.
## Install ZenCompass to see the passage of time.
## NOTE: This is very important when using ZenRaids as you need to know how long before the fire burns out and monsters spawn.
## Also, in a mod like Seasons you need to know if you have enough fuel to last the winter.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Display Fuel Days = true

## [Admin] This will adjust the fuel burn rate on fireplaces so the amount of days remaining when full are easily recognizable numbers. (Vanilla: false)
## Vanilla day lengths and fuel burn times are not evenly divisible resulting in awkward max fuel days.
## This adjusts the burn rate per unit of fuel so they divide evenly with the day length.
## The result is that max fuel days will be easily recognizable days 20, 25, 50, 60 instead of 22, 28, 56, 67.
## [logout required for changes to take effect]
# Setting type: Boolean
