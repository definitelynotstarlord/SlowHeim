## [Admin] Max unmodified inventory carry weight (Vanilla: 300)
## If set to 0 then this config is disabled.
## WARNING: Not recommended to raise this value. 
## Instead it is recommended to use in game items to adjust max carry weight.
## Inventory management, logistics, and hauling cargo is a core part of the gameplay loop.
## These restrictions lead to dynamic emergent gameplay situations.  Ex: Hauling a cart of ore and being attacked by a troll.
## If you raise this value you are nullifying the usefulness of the cart and the requirement to make paths to haul stuff. 
## This will shorten your gameplay loop and make the experience less immersive, which is not the goal of this mod.
## ZenDistributor: Unload cargo into nearby chests and adjust the cart to make the rope stronger and easier to use.
## ZenPath: Make it easier to navigate the cart over paths without using stamina.
