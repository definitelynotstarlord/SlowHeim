## Sign: PRIVATE pins visible only to the player who placed the Sign pin, nobody else can see these.

## Bonfire: large bright sources of light that can be seen by everyone at great distances.
## Tombstone: pin markers are global, everyone can see the tombstone pins for all players.
## Cart: tracked so they don't get lost easily
## WarMachine: BatteringRam and Catapult, tracked.
## SmallBoat: coastal craft, Raft and Karve, tracked.
## LargeShip: deep sea adventures, Longship and Drakkar, tracked.

## [Admin] Map Item is a SNAPSHOT of the current explored area and pins on the map, INCLUDING private Sign pins.
## New pins added after the Map Item is crafted will not be visible. Craft a new map at the table.
## Sign pins are copied from the table to the crafted map and are visible to anyone who looks at that Map Item.
## The pins on the snapshot live update. If the object is destroyed or moved the pin will be updated as well.
## Consider immersion before enabling pins for objects that move, they will live update on the crafted map.
## If you have a cart and pins are configured to show carts then you can easily figure out where you are.
## The default configuration preserves immersion by restricting pins to non-movable objects.
## [enabling pin options requires recrafting existing maps to add the newly enabled pins]
