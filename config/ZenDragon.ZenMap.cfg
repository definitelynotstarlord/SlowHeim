## [Admin] Map Item is a SNAPSHOT of the current explored area and pins on the map, INCLUDING private Sign pins.
## New pins added after the map item is crafted will not be visible. Craft a new map at the table.
## Sign pins are copied from the table to the crafted map and are visible to anyone who looks at that map item.
## The pins on the snapshot live update. If the object is destroyed or moved the pin will be updated as well.
## Consider immersion before enabling pins for objects that move, they will live update on the crafted map.
## If you have a cart and pins are configured to show carts then you can easily figure out where you are.
## The default configuration preserves immersion by restricting pins to non-movable objects except large ships.
## Large ships are enabled by default because a large ship would have onboard navigation and are restricted to water.
## However, if the ship sinks it will not be on the map anymore. Recraft the map and buld a new ship.
## NOTE: The Map Item will not display tracked pins that are not visible on the Cartography Table.
## Example: If Ships are not shown on the Cartography Table they will never display on the Map Item.
## [enabling pin options requires recrafting existing maps to add the newly enabled pins]
